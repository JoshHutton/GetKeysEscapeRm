Welcome! This is an escape room project made in Java that was a collaborative effort between myself and two other former students, who are both credited in all files.
To play the game, download all of the files and run the PlayGame.java file. The "help" command will display a list of commands you can utilize in game should you get stuck!
Have fun!
